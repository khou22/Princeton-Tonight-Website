  <div class="about-history">
    Princeton Tonight was founded in the fall of 2015 by two first year students, Jordan Salama ’19 and Ryan Ozminkowski ’19, upon discovering that there was no student run TV show on Princeton’s campus. With their love for all things entertainment, they quickly rallied together two of their friends, Ben Jacobson ’19 and Rami Farran ’19 to get the show the momentum it needed.

    At its inception, the show consisted solely of simple one on one interviews hosted by Salama and filmed in the Princeton University Broadcast Center. Recognizing the potential of the show to fill a void on campus, many students signed on and the team grew quickly. Backed by more content creators and a wider range of ideas, the show began to expand into more diverse content, evolving from pure interviews into a variety show that paired interviews with sketch comedy, on the street segments, documentaries, and more.

    Only a few months after its founding, Princeton Tonight welcomed Bigshot founder and Billy Joel band-member Mike DelGuidice to campus, where in addition to an interview he gave a small masterclass and concert. With this step, Princeton Tonight became more than just a TV show and began to host live-entertainment events as well. As the TV show itself continued to expand, the live events grew with an equal ambition. What started as a group that could hold seven audience members in a studio interview grew to one that sold out crowds in Richardson Auditorium and McCosh 50 for such talents as music legend Art Garfunkel and comedian Cecily Strong.
    <br>
    The show continues to grow with a vision of creating high quality entertainment across all platforms. Having a diverse team of writers, marketers, financiers, actors, producers and more, it is ready to tackle more projects. Recently, is has merged with Princeton Film Productions and the Princeton Film Festival to create Princeton Studios: Princeton’s home for all things entertainment.
    <br>
    We have many projects in store, and we can’t wait to make them a reality. At the end of the day, all we want to do is entertain people. Won’t you let us?
