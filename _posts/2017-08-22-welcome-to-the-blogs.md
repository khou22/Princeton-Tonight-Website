Hello everyone, it’s Ryan Ozminkowski ‘19 here! I wanted to welcome you all to the Princeton Tonight blogs, a tradition that we hope becomes a cornerstone of PT’s content. We’ll be having blogs from many of our show’s creators including writers, actors, marketers and more. For our inaugural post, we’ll be creating the Founder’s Blog, a little thing by  Jordan, Ben, and me. We’ll be throwing around some of our hopes for the show, general ideas in the entertainment industry, and funny things that we find interesting. Feel free to reach out to us with any questions and check back regularly for more content! 

Cheers,
Ryan
